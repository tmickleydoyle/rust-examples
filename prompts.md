## CLI Todo App

Create a new Rust project for a command-line todo list application. The app should support adding new tasks, listing all tasks, and marking tasks as complete. Tasks should be stored in a local file using JSON or TOML for persistence. Each task should have a unique ID, a description, a creation timestamp, and a status indicating whether it's pending or completed. Use common Rust libraries for CLI argument parsing and data serialization. Organize the code in a modular way with separate files or modules for task definitions and storage logic. Include a README file in the project to explain how to use the todo commands.
